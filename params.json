However, if you ask multiple people the same opinion-based question, the average answer from every person is usually very close to the truth. This research gave birth to the wisdom of the crowd theory. This theory has many real-world applications, such as political opinion polls. The Android application allows anyone to ask a question, add criteria to their question, provide his or her opinions to a question, and receive personalized answers based on their opinion of the criteria.\r\n",
